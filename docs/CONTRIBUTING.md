Hey!

Contributors are welcome!

You can get involved in the project by helping with:
 - architecture design
 - creating modules
 - correcting spelling
 - creating documentation
 - testing SimBatch with specific 3D package

At this moment there is refactoring time (form prototype to alpha).

PEP8 standard will be preserved.

You can/should define basic and at the same time most important settings in config.ini file!

You can define custom file with startup settings by editing value "ini_file" in your startup file.

SimBatch("env_mode", ini_file="my_config.ini")
SimBatch("env_mode", ini_file="/srv/sib/custom_config.ini")



By default framework will look for this file in the diectory:

/your_instalation_directory/simbatch/



for unit tests you can define independent settings in separate file 

/your_instalation_directory/tests/config_tests.ini



for developement and testing purposes you can create: 

/your_instalation_directory/simbatch/config_dev.ini

if this file exists then these settings will be loaded as the default (also for the unit test)
